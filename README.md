## Description

Cryptocurrency traders regularly face minor problems when they trade on different websites that cause inconvenience since the traders have to complete authentication over and over again and have to switch tabs or windows regularly, which consumes too much time and may cause confusion and further inconvenience while trading. Moreover, the user interface design of most websites contains too much information on one page, which frequently leads to distraction and confusion.

Our website, **A Trading Position Management Platform**, solves these problems by providing users with easy access to their accounts across multiple exchanges. By simply inputting their API Keys into our website, users can seamlessly switch between exchanges without the need to log in and authenticate repeatedly. Our centralized platform supports API integration with various exchanges, enabling users to access and manage their accounts effortlessly.

Moreover, our website consists of necessary features including user accounts, price charts, and trading history as the main functions. With a well-organized alignment of our user interface design, the users can find and use these functions more easily, which will be beneficial for new users to pro users.
